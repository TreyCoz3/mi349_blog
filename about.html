<h2>About Trey Cosnowski</h2>

  <div id="text_list">
    <p>My name is William Cosnowski III, but my entire life I have gone by Trey. I am a senior at Michigan State Univeristy graduating in Spring 2024 with a degree in Computer Science. My hometown that I grew up in is Rochester, Michigan. My favorite hobby is sports. My while life I grew up playing sports. Here is a list of my ranking of the 4 major sports in the United states:</p>
    <div id="custom_list">
      <ul>
        <li >Football</li>
        <li>Baseball</li>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>Hockey</li>
    </ul>

    Now since I no longer play those sports, they are always on my TV. My roomates and I will sit down together and watch sports throught the day no matter what is on. A lot of people ask my why I chose Computer Science as my major because it is really hard for a lot of people. The explanation that I give everyone is I would rather code all day long than write a paper. The main reason why I chose it is because I love to code at the end of the day. It may have some challenges to it, but it is a lot of fun for me to do so I am happy that I stuck with it through out my college carrer.
